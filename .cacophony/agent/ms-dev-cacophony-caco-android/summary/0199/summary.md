# Session summary — bd-fd53d7 WearOS terminal Ctrl-G quick key

## Goal

Stage a WearOS terminal `Ctrl-G` quick key helper for future full-screen PTY input wiring and cancel/bell workflows.

## Bead(s)

- `bd-fd53d7` — WearOS terminal quick keys: add Ctrl-G cancel helper
- Focused child of `bd-7b4a80`

## Before state

- Failing tests: none known before this slice.
- Relevant metrics: WearOS PTY quick-key helpers included many control keys but did not include Ctrl-G/BEL.

## After state

- Failing tests: none from focused validation.
- Relevant metrics: `WatchPtyFramesSourceTest` and `WatchTerminalShellSourceTest` passed; `:wearable:assembleRelease` passed.
- Context: `WatchPtyQuickKey.CtrlG` emits canonical BEL (`\u0007`) as an input frame, and the terminal preview label list includes `Ctrl-G`. This remains helper-only and does not open WebSockets or send input from UI.

## Diff summary

- Code/content commits: local implementation commit recorded before final reintegration; final landed squash SHA will come from the reintegration receipt.
- Summary artefact commit: intentionally omitted; this file must not self-reference its own mutable SHA.
- Files touched: `WatchPtyFrames.kt`, `WatchPtyFramesSourceTest.kt`, `WatchTerminalShellSourceTest.kt`.
- Tests: `:wearable:testDebugUnitTest --tests WatchPtyFramesSourceTest --tests WatchTerminalShellSourceTest`, `:wearable:assembleRelease`.

## Operator-takeaway

WearOS terminal protocol helpers are closer to full input support with a staged Ctrl-G/cancel quick key, without enabling live input yet.
