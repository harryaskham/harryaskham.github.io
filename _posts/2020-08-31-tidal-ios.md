# Caveat

This is a writeup for my mobile setup for Emacs music composition - but iOS being iOS, this does require access to a Linux machine for most of the heavy lifting, with something like Blink on the phone as a thin client.


# Previously: funktor + PulseAudio streaming

*Song composition in Emacs in Blink on iOS*

For a while now I&rsquo;ve wanted a fully mobile programmatic music generation solution. I&rsquo;d previously set this up using my own Haskell library [funktor](<https://github.com/harryaskham/funktor>), which is an interpretive layer on top of \`csound-expression\` allowing terse music creation in a Haskell DSL.

I&rsquo;d use Blink on iOS to connect to Emacs-in-tmux running on my VPS, with `ghcid` watching for changes, constantly reloading my track when saving the file. To stream audio, I&rsquo;d transcode the VPS&rsquo;s PulseAudio output on-the-fly, [expose it to the internet](<https://superuser.com/questions/605445/how-to-stream-my-gnu-linux-audio-output-to-android-devices-over-wi-fi/1021823?noredirect=1#comment2066805_1021823>), and connect to it using the iOS VLC app in the background. This gives about a second of latency.

For posterity, I&rsquo;m streaming Pulse via:

{% highlight sh %}
cvlc -vvv pulse://$(pactl list | grep "Monitor Source" | awk '{print $3}') \
    --sout '#transcode{acodec=mp3,ab=128,channels=2}:standard{access=http,dst=0.0.0.0:8888/pc.mp3}'
{% endhighlight %}


# Moving to TidalCycles

I recently realised I had more or less made a [TidalCycles](<https://tidalcycles.org>) lookalike with this setup. I&rsquo;d wanted to try out Tidal for a while, and given its extreme terseness and focus on transience and experimentation rather than song composition, I figured it&rsquo;d be an even better fit for the mobile interaction use-case.

I followed the [Linux Installation](<https://tidalcycles.org/index.php/Linux_installation>) instructions on my VPS, installing the Emacs Tidal package and getting to the point where I could get Supercollider/Superdirt/Tidal-in-Emacs talking.


# Streaming JACK over the Network

The sticking point for me was that as I understand it, starting SuperDirt also suspends PulseAudio - the Tidal stack uses JACK instead. Thankfully, it was relatively straightforward to stream SuperCollider&rsquo;s JACK output over the network via VLC:

{% highlight sh %}
$ cvlc -vvv "jack://channels=2:ports=.*out_1,.*out_2" \
    --sout '#transcode{acodec=mp3,ab=128,channels=2}:standard{access=http,dst=0.0.0.0:8888/pc.mp3}'
{% endhighlight %}

With this running (and SuperDirt running in the background), one can open a `.tidal` file in Emacs, `C-c C-s` to bring up Tidal, and play around with very little latency.

We need to open SuperDirt first before streaming JACK, otherwise we end up with a race for port 57120.

The end result looks something like:
