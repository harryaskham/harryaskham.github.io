### Caveat

This is a writeup for my mobile setup for Emacs music composition - but iOS being iOS, this does require access to a Linux machine for most of the heavy lifting, with something like Blink on the phone as a thin client.

## Previously: funktor + PulseAudio streaming

*Song composition in Emacs in Blink on iOS*

For a while now I've wanted a fully mobile programmatic music generation solution. I'd previously set this up using my own Haskell library [funktor](https://github.com/harryaskham/funktor), which is an interpretive layer on top of `csound-expression` allowing terse music creation in a Haskell DSL.

I'd use Blink on iOS to connect to Emacs-in-tmux running on my VPS, with `ghcid` watching for changes, constantly reloading my track when saving the file. To stream audio, I'd transcode the VPS's PulseAudio output on-the-fly, [expose it to the internet](https://superuser.com/questions/605445/how-to-stream-my-gnu-linux-audio-output-to-android-devices-over-wi-fi/1021823?noredirect=1#comment2066805_1021823), and connect to it using the iOS VLC app in the background. This gives about a second of latency.

For posterity, I'm streaming Pulse via:

```sh
cvlc -vvv pulse://$(pactl list | grep "Monitor Source" | awk '{print $3}') \
    --sout '#transcode{acodec=mp3,ab=128,channels=2}:standard{access=http,dst=0.0.0.0:8888/pc.mp3}'
```

## Moving to TidalCycles

I recently realised I had more or less made a [TidalCycles](https://tidalcycles.org) lookalike with this setup. I'd wanted to try out Tidal for a while, and given its extreme terseness and focus on transience and experimentation rather than song composition, I figured it'd be an even better fit for the mobile interaction use-case.

I followed the [Linux Installation](https://tidalcycles.org/index.php/Linux_installation) instructions on my VPS, installing the Emacs Tidal package and getting to the point where I could get Supercollider/Superdirt/Tidal-in-Emacs talking.

### Streaming JACK over the Network
The sticking point for me was that as I understand it, starting SuperDirt also suspends PulseAudio - the Tidal stack uses JACK instead. Thankfully, it was relatively straightforward to stream SuperCollider's JACK output over the network via VLC:

```sh
$ cvlc -vvv "jack://channels=2:ports=.*out_1,.*out_2" \
    --sout '#transcode{acodec=mp3,ab=128,channels=2}:standard{access=http,dst=0.0.0.0:8888/pc.mp3}'
```

With this running (and SuperDirt running in the background), one can open a `.tidal` file in Emacs, `C-c C-s` to bring up Tidal, and play around with very little latency.

We need to open SuperDirt first before streaming JACK, otherwise we end up with a race for port 57120.

The end result looks something like:
